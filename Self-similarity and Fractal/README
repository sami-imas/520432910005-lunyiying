Inspired by coral reef, I explore the concept of self-similarity and fractual with processing.
After the plankton died, they will stacked on the original coral reef bodies generations after generations.
I used random to simulate the dynamics of the plankton. The scope of the plankton and the final shape of the coral reef could be controlled with the mouse.
